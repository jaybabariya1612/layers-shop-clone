        <p>
          <span>
            We aim to ship orders within 24 hours. However, during peak times
            (like holidays or big sale events), processing may take a bit
            longer - up to 2-3 business days. Rest assured, as soon as your
            order is on its way, we’ll keep you updated with the tracking
            details.
            <br />
            We are currently shipping exclusively within India.
            <br />
            <u>P.S</u>.: In case any of the freebies were not selected during
            the order process, we will not be including it in the shipment.
            You may choose to cancel your order before the shipment is
            generated and place a new order with the missing item. In case
            your selected freebie is not in stock, Layers reserves the right
            to include another color/exclude it as per availability. Please
            note that free items are not eligible for returns or replacements.

        <h1>Tracking Your Order</h1>

          <span>
            Once your order ships, you’ll receive a confirmation email with a
            tracking ID. You can use this ID to follow your order’s journey on
            our logistics partner’s website or simply click
            <a href="https://www.shiprocket.in/shipment-tracking/">here</a>

            possible once order has been shipped or accepted during delivery.
            <br />
            Refunds are automatically initiated to the original payment source
            upon order cancellation and typically reflect within 3 to 7
            business days, depending on your payment provider.

            At Layers, we strive to ensure the satisfaction of our customers.
            However, we do not offer refunds once a sale has been completed
            and the product has been successfully delivered.
          </span>
          <span>Please note, we do not offer refunds based on looks, feel, or

        <h1>Replacement Policy</h1>
        <p>
          <span>
            If you experience any issues, we’re here to help! Please review
            our policy below regarding returns and replacements.
            <br />
            <u>For Mobile/Laptop Skins:</u>
            <br />
            If you notice a manufacturing issue with your mobile skin, you can
            request a replacement within 3 days of delivery.
            <br />
            <u>For Anarc:</u>
            <br />
            If you notice a technical issue with your smartwatch, you can
            request a replacement within 7 days of delivery. We’ll send out a
            fresh one after a quick check. If there’s no issue found, we’ll
            return your original unit.
            <br />
            Click <a href="get_in_touch.html">here</a> to submit your request
            for replacement
            <br />
            If you raise a claim after 7 days but still within the warranty
            period, we’ll test it and replace it with a comparable unit if
            needed. And if your model is out of stock, we’ll offer an
            equivalent alternative, keeping your warranty intact based on the
            original purchase date.
          </span>

        <h1>Damaged or Incorrect Deliveries</h1>

            missing accessories, please let us know within 24 hours of
            delivery. Just shoot us an email with your order ID and some pics
            of the product, and we’ll get it sorted out.
            <br />
            If your packaging looks tampered with or damaged, it’s best to
            refuse the order upon delivery.

            consider reports that come in after this window. To keep things

        <h1>Warranty</h1>
        <p>
          <span>
            Your Anarc Smartwatch is backed by a 1-year limited warranty that
            kicks in from the moment you unbox it. This coverage lasts for 12
            months from your purchase date, regardless of usage. Note that
            Mobile/Laptop skins are not covered under this warranty.
            <br />
            If you encounter any issues, simply get in touch with us, and
            we’ll assist you with troubleshooting or getting your watch issues
            fixed/replaced under the warranty.
            <br />
            To save your hassle, we don't have physical service centers. The
            good part is that we offer the convenience of claiming the
            warranty at your doorstep. We will offer remote assistance for
            software issues, and any hardware issues will be addressed through
            doorstep pickup and delivery.

            <br />
            <u>-Battery Woes:</u> If your battery isn’t performing like it

        <p>
          <span>
            We want you to get the most out of your smartwatch experience, but
            there are a few things that aren’t covered by our warranty, like:
            <p>
              - Physical Damage: Scratches, dings, or any damage from mishaps.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Normal Wear and Tear: Because life happens, and your watch
              might show signs of love.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Unauthorized Fixes: If you’ve let someone else tinker with
              your watch, we can’t cover that.
            </p>
            <br />
            Remember, this warranty won’t cover:
            <p>- Damage from misuse, accidents, or unauthorized repairs.</p>
            <p>
              - Issues from exposure to liquids, extreme temperatures, or
              pesky critters.
            </p>
            <p><b>- Regular wear and tear from everyday use.</b></p>
          </span>
        </p>
        <h1>How to Claim Warranty</h1>
        <p>
          <span>If something’s gone wrong and you think it’s covered, just reach out to our friendly customer support
            team within the warranty period. Here’s what we need:</span>

        <br />
        <u>For return shipping (Anarc):</u>
        <br />
        In most cases, we’ll arrange a return pickup for you. However, if your pincode isn’t serviceable, we’ll provide

        gets to us safely. Please note, the shipping cost will be covered by you in this case.

        <h1>Snapmint Payment Plan Terms</h1>
        <p>
          <span>
            <p>
              We’ve partnered with Snapmint to offer flexible payment options,
              making it easier for you to own the products you love. Here’s a
              quick overview of how the Snapmint payment plan works:
            </p>
            <p>
              - Snapmint’s payment plan is available to eligible customers at
              checkout based on Snapmint's criteria.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Eligibility may depend on your credit profile and prior
              payment history with Snapmint.
            </p>
            <p>
              - You may be required to make a small down payment at the time
              of order placement to activate the Snapmint payment plan.
            </p>
            <p>
              - The remaining balance is split into EMIs that can be paid over
              3/6 months.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Certain EMI options may offer 0% interest, while others may
              carry a nominal interest rate. Interest terms, if applicable,
              will be clearly specified at checkout.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Snapmint EMIs are automatically debited from your registered
              bank account, credit card, or wallet as per the schedule.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: If you cancel your order or initiate a return, any refunds
              will be processed according to their policy. Snapmint may adjust
              or terminate remaining installments depending on the refund
              amount.
            </p>
          </span>
        </p>
        <h1>Partial Payment Policy (For Anarc Only)</h1>
        <p>
          <span>
            <p>
              To make your shopping experience easier, Layers offers a Partial
              Payment option in association with Gokwik. Here’s how it works:
            </p>
            <p>
              Initial Payment at Checkout: At the time of placing your order,
              you will be required to pay a partial amount upfront. This
              amount is a portion of your total order value and confirms your
              commitment to the purchase.
            </p>
            <p><u>Remaining Balance Payment:</u></p>
            <p>
              <b>For COD:</b> The remaining balance will be collected at the
              time of delivery by our delivery partner.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>For Pre-payment:</b> If you prefer to complete your payment
              before delivery, you can do so one week before shipment using a
              link we’ll send to you via our payment partner. This link will
              allow you to securely complete your payment online.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Please note that the initial payment made during order placement
              is non-refundable. In the event of an order cancellation or
              return due to logistical reasons, the payment made will be
              non-refundable.
